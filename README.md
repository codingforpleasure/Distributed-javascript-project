# Distributed-javascript-project

This is a project we have been working on for all the *book* lovers out there!

The projectâ€™s intention is to maintain and to beautify literature by collecting beautiful phrases, taken from books, which describe feelings and emotions.
The site will provide a front-end to a large database, which is going to be categorized by emotion type. Each primary node will hold a specific emotion, and all surrounding neighbor nodes are going to be phrases which will describe this specific emotion.

The collection of phrases would be updated and enhanced by the visitors of the web-site, who can contribute to the site using apps for their smartphones (OCR is involved).


Our To-do list tasks:

 1. Visualize the data interactively via D3 Graphs
 2. Manipulate the data via MySQL queries on the back-end database
 3. Solve security & authentication issues.
 4. Develop a user friendly Android app for the web-site (First priority)
 5. Develop a user friendly iPhone app for the web-site (Second priority)
 6. Release the beta version to the book readers community :)
