A project I have been working on for all BOOK lovers out there!


The project's intention is to maintain and to beautify literature via collecting beautiful phrases taken from books which describe feelings and emotions.
The site would hold a large database under the hood which are categorized by emotion type. each main-node would hold a specific emotion, and all surrounding neighbour nodes would be phrases which will be describing/ this specific emotion.

The collection of phrases would be updated and evolved by the surfers who can contribute easily to the site via there smart-phone app (OCR is involved).


My To-do list tasks:

 1. Visulize the data interactively via D3 Graphs
 2. Manipulate the data via mySQL queries which resides under the site's hood
 3. Solve security & authentications issues for the
 4. Develop a user friendly Android app for the website (First priority)
 5. Develop a user friendly iPhone app for the website (Second priority)
